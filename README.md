# LAMdb

## Welcome to our LAMDdb app!
It’s hard to keep track of vet records and invoices over the years, and most of us as pet owners rely solely on our email to do so. No matter if you have one fur-baby or five, that lack of organization makes managing our pet health history a challenging and daunting task! 

This app will: 
- Be the single point of organization that keeps track of your pet’s records for their wellbeing.
- Store important information about your pets’ in their pet profile (this includes allergies, microchip number, behavior notes etc).
- Store individual vet records for each vet visit your pet has.

We hope you enjoy this app!
